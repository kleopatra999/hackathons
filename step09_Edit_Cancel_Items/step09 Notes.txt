Step 16 Notes: 

Goal - Add 'edit item' and cancel post functionality



1. Red admin dropdown under price tag appears only if logged in user is poster of item & item is 'available'

2. Create 2 $scope models- isItemPoster and isAvailable that can then be used in ng-show directives
	Hint: You just need 2 lines of code!

3. Add ng-show directives and html in browse.html

4. Next, add directives to ensure 'Make offer' button appears only if you are not the item poster and item is still availabe


5. Now that view is in place, add edit item code to getItems service and itemController

6. Create edit item modal and add ng-include directive to browse.html

7. Finally, add cancelItem code in browse controller

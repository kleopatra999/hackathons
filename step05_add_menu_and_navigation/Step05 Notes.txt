Step 9 Notes:


Split index.html into index and browse.html

	Just remove the <ul> </ul> ng-repeat loop from index.html and put it in browse.html and surround it with a <div>. 

Load angular-route.js through index.html. Just copy the angular.js line and replace it with angular-route.js


Put the <div ng-view=""></div> in place of the ng-repeat <ul> list


Modify app.js to add the app.config($routeprovider) piece. Make sure you added the ['ngRoute'] dependency in app.module at the top!


Add some more routes in app.js and adding partials for other simple html pages

---------

Next, create nav.html and add ng-include in index.html. Note how navbar has different links for Browse, Login, Register etc. Create different partials and create routes in app.js

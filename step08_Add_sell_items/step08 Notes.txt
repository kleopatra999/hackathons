Step 15 Notes: 

Goal - Add 'newItem' functionality



1. Note that 'List stuff for sale' comes up only when user signs in. Add html in navbar.html with ng-show directives for it
	(note to self - already existed from copy/paste. Remove from previous steps)


2. Create a partials folder under views and create a post.html modal for new Items

3. Add ng-include directives in nav.html

4. Add code to getItems service to create  items

5. Note that post.html uses its own controller - itemController so create a seperate item.js under controllers and add item controller code to create  items

6. Make sure item.js is added to index

I've removed the ng-show directive from the post.html div at the bottom since it seemed unnecessary

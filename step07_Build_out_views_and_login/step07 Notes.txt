Step 13 Notes: 

Goal - Add login/logout functionality. Current user info and services

There are 2 pieces to user management. 1- The auth service and controller which is used for user registration, login and password change, and 2 - the navController which listens for the user event broadcast by the rootscope



1. Build user services in auth.js

2. Write the controller logic for authController. 

3. Build  views register.html and login.html

4. Add routes for register and login in app.js

5. move browse, login and register htmls to /views

6. Include ng-animate and toaster scripts in index.html


Pose a challenge - there is a complete page refresh each time you click an item. Make it go away.

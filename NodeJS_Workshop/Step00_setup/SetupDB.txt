Here is the general outline to the steps needed to setup the DB instances for the Hackathon

On Each Provisioned Account
1) Create DB instance called NodeDB with local storage (1 OCPU, Enterprise Edition with a Pluggable Database)
2) The password for the NodeDB is to be Welcome1#
2) Wait for DB to be provisioned (make note of the IP and connection string)
3) On the Compute side enable the DB listener for that DB instance
4) Connect in your SQl Editor of choice - I used a local instance of SQL Developer
5) Connect it into the system account of the Pluggable DB (user: system, password: Welcome1#)
6) Run the create_users.sql script. This will provision both a demouser and a devuser for use in the hackathon
7) Both passwords are set to the same Welcome1#
8) Login to devuser account on the pluggable DB (user:devuser, password: Welcome1#)
9) Run the setup_applicaiton.sql script - this will ensure all tables and test data is created in that schema
10) Repeat steps 8 and 9 with the demouser

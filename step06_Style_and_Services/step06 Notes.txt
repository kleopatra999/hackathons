Step 11 Notes: 

Goal - Start building the RHS top portion. Use services and $resource

1. Change <ul> to <a tag with ng-href so each item in the list is a link. colors may be green when you hover since the css is not yet present. Just cut/paste the entire main.css from end-product or cut/paste the hover classes


2. modify app.js to include new route for /browse/:itemId

3. Make sure the api is working

4. Break out the controller code and put it in a separate file browse.js under folder controllers. 
5. Modify index.js to include browse.js
6. Create a factory service for findItem
	
	a. Load angular-resource in index.js
	b. Add ng-Resource dependency in angular.module
	c. Create folder services under scripts and create item.js for item related services
	d. Include item.js in index.html
	e. Create service 'Item' in item.js and add code in controller to call it.

7. Modify browse.html using $scope.selectedItem to populate rhs view. Note that panels for offers, comments are created but no code is added. Similarly, html/css for ADMIN and Make Offer are created
